    "Behance is a community art website where users showcase and discover creative work. Each user is able to “appreciate” (equivalent to a “like” on Instagram or a “react” on Facebook) an image, indicating that they like the image. It is in the website’s best interests to show users pictures that they would like, to keep them engaged for longer. For this question, given a set of pictures that a user has already appreciated, you have to show them a new picture that they would like based on what similar users appreciated.\n",
